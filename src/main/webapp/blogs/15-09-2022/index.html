            The year was 2020, and I had just completed my 2nd pre-university exam. I was searching for a method to download videos from youtube on my phone. I was fed up with apps like Vidmate which showed too many ads in its UI. I wanted an app that was minimal and which gets the job done in fewer clicks. Then I came across termux(a terminal emulator for android) and youtube-dl(a python package to download content from youtube). This is how my initial journey began.<br><br>

            Even though termux was just an emulator it helped me a lot to build up my basics. Slowly I began exploring all kinds of tools available for termux like Metasploit, shellphish, and spot-dl. I was a script kiddie at that time and I didn't even know that termux was similar to a Linux terminal.<br><br>
            
            After a few days, I googled "how to install termux on windows laptop" and it was at that moment I realized that termux was similar to a linux terminal. Then I decided to install Linux on my HP shintel pentium laptop. Using VM in my laptop was out of reach since it had only 4gigs of ram and my only option was to dual boot. So after doing a lot of research and watching a lot of Youtube tutorials, I decided to install Ubuntu 18.4 on my laptop. And that was the day I broke up with windows and fell in love with linux. From ubuntu, I have hopped to many distros which include Debian, kali, parrot, pop, manjaro, arch, and fedora and I'm currently using OpenSuse in my Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3 laptop. (and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for this server)<br><br>
